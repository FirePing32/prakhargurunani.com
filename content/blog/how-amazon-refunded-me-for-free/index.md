Amazon has been shipping millions of items around the globe everyday with great satisfaction. *The tech giant has captured nearly 39 to 45 % of the E-commerce market share in the United States of America.* In the early years of the startup, its revenue was quite booming. People trusted it‚Äôs distribution system and soon [Amazon Publishing](https://amazonpublishing.amazon.com/), [Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/) and many other services and products were launched by the company to expand its market value.

Though its aim is to make the product in reach to the end user and expand company's assets, it did not brainstorm much about its infrastructure.

I had purchased a USB to SATA HDD adapter cable from [Amazon.in](http://amazon.in) like this one üëá.

![Images always look stunning; Not real products](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*dgHWSphnu6z5Dgz9z0nH5w.jpeg)*Images always look stunning; Not real products*

I had a 9 year old desktop loaded with Intel Pentium 2.8 GHz and 1 GB RAM. No one would use this computer in the 21st century. But inside the case was a Seagate 80 GB 7200 RPM hard disk. I could not believe what I saw in that vintage PC. I just detached the hard disk and threw away the rest of it.

I had planned to install Ubuntu 19.04 Disco-Dingo release as it was recently released with some awesome features.

But when the adapter arrived, I was like ‚Äî üòê üòë . I constantly looked at my hard drive like this üëá.

![My hard disk had a IDE port like this one and not a SATA port](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2600/1*6Ktie7q1Moc0B2irUcB6aA.jpeg)*My hard disk had a IDE port like this one and not a SATA port*

It was clearly mentioned in the description that it would work with IDE ports as well. It even had an image showing a 2.5 inch Seagate HDD connected to the adapter. Now I had nothing to do with it rather than return it back to Amazon.

When I filled the return request for the same, I was amazed that the seller approved my request rather than asking any other questions or the condition of the item.

![Some relief](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2046/1*6hlUy7kI4_JmSbr1J4SLWg.png)*Some relief*

Though the return request was approved, it was written that I had to self ship it to the seller‚Äôs manufacturing unit to get the item refunded. When I downloaded the return request form, the address of the seller‚Äôs headquarters was ***China.***

The cost of shipping it to China was more than double the cost of the adapter and the import duties was also an extra load. So I decided not to return it and keep it with myself.

A few days after, I got üëá mail in my inbox.

![I was down to Earth seeing this](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2052/1*m3-9zxlxSOD3FoOwjyOKyQ.jpeg)*I was down to Earth seeing this*

What the hell was this ! Amazon, please ‚Äî do something possible. At first, I thought it was a spam. But no ! It was a legit e-mail from [Amazon Returns](https://www.amazon.com/ap/signin?clientContext=133-4221984-5313108&openid.return_to=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fspr%2Freturns&openid.identity=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&openid.assoc_handle=amzn_psr_desktop_us&openid.mode=checkid_setup&marketPlaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&openid.claimed_id=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0%2Fidentifier_select&pageId=Amazon&openid.ns=http%3A%2F%2Fspecs.openid.net%2Fauth%2F2.0&openid.pape.max_auth_age=3600&siteState=clientContext%3D134-3558369-8820052%2CsourceUrl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.amazon.com%252Fspr%252Freturns%2Csignature%3DHTeGdZTIoeaGhj2Bvj2FoDPfdEPPzkAj3D).

Amazon has a large number of sellers from around the globe. So, it becomes difficult to coordinate each and every transaction with the seller. As soon as the seller approves the return request, Amazon instantly processes the amount and transfers to your bank account without tracking the package whether it has reached the seller or not.

The above theory only applies to third party sellers. It does not apply on **Amazon basics** products.

Now, I have the adapter with me and my pockets are also full. Cheers ! **üòä**
